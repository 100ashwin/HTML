# HTML: HyperText Markup Language


## Introduction


HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

**Important Notes**

- Head & body tags are children of HTML Tag.
- HTML is the parent of Head & Body tags.
- Most of the HTML elements have opening & closing tag with content in between opening & closing tags.
- Some HTML tags have no content. These are called Empty elements eg. <br>
- We can either use `.htm` or `.html` extention.
- You can use `"Inspect Element"` or `"View Page Source"` option from chrome to look into a website's HTML Code.

- HTML Element  
` <start tag> + content + </end tag> `

- Comments in HTML are used to mark text which should not be parsed. They can help document to source code.  
` <!-- HTML Comment --> `

- HTML is a case insensitive language `<H1>` and `<h1>` tags are the same. (best practice, use lowercase.)
